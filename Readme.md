# ManImRes â€“ MANifold-valued IMage REStoration

This collection of functions dealing with processing of manifold valued data.

## Available Manifolds
* The Circle `S1` for phase valued data
* The vector-valued (product) manifold `S1mRn`

## Installation, Initialization

For installation just place the folder ManImRes somewhere in your preferred  
directory. On Startup be sure to have `ManImRes` as your base directory or  
call `initManImRes();` from anywhere. By default it adds all necessary folders  
to the MATLAB path and initializes the debug helping functions.

## Getting Started
To get started with the remaining features have a look at the `examples/` folder
or take a look at the `algorithms/` and `manifolds/` functions and classes.
